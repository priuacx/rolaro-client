# Rolaro Bootstrapper
A bootstrapper written in Rust meant to replace the old Roblox Launcher

You are welcome to add support to other platforms ( *MacOS* ) or add improvements to the bootstrapper

## Building
For Windows:
> win-build-release.bat

For Linux:
> cargo build --release

If you want to build the debug version of the bootstrapper for development you can run
> cargo build

-- this is built from Syntax bootstrapper, after modification from kittyblox, so if you see anything referencing any of this its because im way too fucking lazy to change anything.
